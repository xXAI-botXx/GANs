# GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks


---
### Introduction

GANs are the counter part to discriminative models and don't have a specific goal during training but also self-improves it and so it is a technique between supervised and unsupervised.
A GAN tries to learn the characteristics of the given data and gives a similiar novel output. It is possible that the human brain works like a GAN which let researches believe that a truly AI have something to do with GANs.
Most interesting is GAN implemented with Deep Learning, the current most promising approach in machine learning.
